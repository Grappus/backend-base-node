# Middlewares
> - This package will contain middlewares that will be used for performing tasks before a request reaches its intended controller function. 
> - Each middlware must define the task it performs in simple pseudocode.
> - Each middleware must be atomic in its functionality.
> - Middleware must be written with/without assuming its usage order, i.e. it may even be last in the order.
